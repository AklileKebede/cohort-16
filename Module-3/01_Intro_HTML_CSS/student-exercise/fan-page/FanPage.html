            Jonathan McAloon of The Daily Telegraph commented,<em>"Bennington’s death will have an impact on many millennials because his voice was the sound of their millennium"</em>.
        </ul>

            Writing for The Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas noted <em>"Bennington’s decision to sing clearly and openly was, therefore, more radical than he is given credit for, and indeed more socially valuable"</em>. The journalist continued to discuss Bennington's impact, commenting,
            <em>His cleanly articulated tales of emotional struggle gave millions the sense that someone understood them, and the huge sound of his band around him magnified that sense, moving listeners from the psychic space of their bedrooms into an arena of thousands of people who shared their pain."</em>
